# Rest-API-with-Spring-Batch
Learning Spring Batch and creating REST APIs for the dataset used.

Through this project I learnt how to store data from a csv file to the database and then fetch the same using REST APIs.

Firstly, Spring Batch was used to convert the data from the csv file and store it in the database.
Then REST APIs were created to fetch that data.
